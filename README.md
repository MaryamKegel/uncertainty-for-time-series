# uncertainty-for-time-series
In this project, I am looking at the different possible ways to compute the uncertainty for the predictions using an LSTM model. 
The data used in this project can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/electric-power-consumption-data-set/code
You find the results based on the dropout method in model_with_dropout.ipynb. 



This work started as my final project for Data Science Bootcamp at Spiced Academy, Berlin. More methods will be added to it over time.
